# Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Shor Code

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating key concepts in quantum information:

- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: Simulates how two parties can securely share a cryptographic key using quantum mechanics (e.g., BB84 protocol).
- **Quantum Error Correction (Shor Code)**: Implements a basic error correction scheme to protect quantum information against bit-flip and phase-flip errors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Qiskit
